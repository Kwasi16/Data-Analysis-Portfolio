# Kwasi Appiah-Gyimah Ofori-Karikari

As a Data Specialist with a background in Geo-Information and Earth Observation, I specialize in data analysis, machine learning, and remote sensing to extract actionable insights from complex environmental and climatic datasets. I am passionate about bringing my strong analytical foundation, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Continuously expanding my skill set, I enjoy working with diverse datasets—whether independently or collaboratively—to solve real-world problems.

## Technical Proficiency:
- Data collection and assembling using cloud-based platforms like Google earth engine using Javascript.
- Data wrangling, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis using Python, R.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and deriving data-driven solutions for environmental challenges.
- Using statistical and machine learning techniques for climate change modeling, dynamic land-use change analysis, and protected area management.
- Developeing models for carbon sequestration estimation and forest degradation assessment using optical remote sensing and biomass estimation.
- Utilizing deep learning for phenology mapping to analyze crop growth stages across seasons.
- Processing large-scale geospatial datasets to identify patterns and trends in natural resource management.

*Driven by curiosity and passion, I try to bridge the gap between environmental science and data-driven decision-making. My motive is to explore how data can illuminate solutions for our planet's most pressing challenges.*
